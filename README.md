# AVnotsecurity
why an av is not a all in one security sollution

## Intro
a commen misconception is that having anti-virus software installed is being fully secured.  
In this short project i wil show you how anti-virus doesnt detect a data exfiltration using task schedular and powershell.  
 
## setup
For this Project the setup is simple i will use the following:

- windows 10 victim (wil probebly work with window 11)
- azure storage acount
- github repo

In this scenario we go on the assumption initial access is already achieved.
